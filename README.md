## üöÄ Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**
- Scripts under `.idea/` perform:
  - Dropping empty or redundant columns
  - Schema generation using inferred data types
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 2. **Data Preprocessing with Spark**
- Located in `Preprocessing/` folder:
  - Spark notebooks join raw tables and apply business logic
  - Output is a cleaned and consolidated dataset ready for reporting

### 3. **Dashboard Creation**
- Located in `UXUI/` folder:
  - Final `.pbix` file contains the Power BI supplier performance dashboard
  - `.ase` file defines Equifruit brand color palette used for consistent styling
  - Excel metadata file maps dashboard fields to underlying schema
